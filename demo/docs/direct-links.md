# Direct Links

Every FAQ entry gets a stable anchor that can be shared as a deep link to that specific question.

## How slugs are derived

The plugin converts the `question` text to a URL-safe slug:

1. Convert to lowercase
2. Strip characters that are not alphanumeric, whitespace, or hyphens
3. Trim leading and trailing whitespace
4. Replace spaces and underscores with hyphens
5. Collapse runs of hyphens to a single hyphen

For example: `"How do I reset my password?"` → `how-do-i-reset-my-password`

## Duplicate slug disambiguation

If two questions produce the same slug, the second gets a `-2` suffix, the third `-3`, and so on. Slugs are assigned in file read order (alphabetical by filename).

## The permalink icon

Each question row shows a `#` link on hover. Clicking it copies the URL fragment to the browser address bar and adds it to the browser history.

## Auto-expand on load

When a visitor lands on the FAQ page with a fragment in the URL (e.g. `/faqs#how-do-i-reset-my-password`), the matching entry is automatically expanded and scrolled into view. This also works when navigating between pages within the same Docusaurus site.
